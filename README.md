# MineSweeper-Solver


TODO:
 * Decouple the solver from the game engine (makePlay and alikes);
 * Split functionality into multiple files (make it work); DONE
 * Clean main function;
 * Include the group with all the cells (maybe use a pointer in the struct instead of 2D array);

 To compile the program just use make.
